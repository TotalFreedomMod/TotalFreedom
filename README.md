"H-hey! Let me out!"

Don't mind that, it's just the server. You see, I've trapped it inside of this box where no new players can get in, forcing it to slowly die off. When any new players DO get in, however, I simply invoke my signature "unstable server" power and whisk them away.

"P-please...I need m-more players..."

Haha, isn't that funny? For a second, I thought I heard something. But no, that would be impossible!

"Pl-please...**play.totalfreedom.me**...you h-have to join..."

Haha...excuse me for a moment while I go *deal with this*...

"W-wait! No! Don't add another bug! Please! NOOOO-"
